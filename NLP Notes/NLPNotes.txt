#Text Vectorization and pre-processing:
     VECTORIZATION(Frequency Based)
    -Bag of words(Simple frequency,Relative frequency,Text Frequency and Inverse document frequency)
    -Words may be unigrams/N-grams with N being 2,3,4.......
    ADVANCED VECTORIZATION
    -Text/word Embedding

    PRE-PROCESSING
    -Natural Language Preprocessing
    -Preprocessing in NLP
    -Tokenization: converts a single sentence/ text into single words
    -Lowercasing: convert all words to lowercase
    -Base form of the word: Convert words to single base form,finds unique word in words that share a common meaning(jump,jumped,jumping,jumps to jump) uses: stemming,lemmatization
    -stopword removal: removing common words that are for english like this, she , the e.t.c. This words are not important hence removal
    -Punctuation removal
    -Remove contraction e.g. from can't to cannot

#Text embeddings
- this uses text relationships and semantics to classify words instead of frequency
- We  have CBOW nad Skip-gram
- Use of techniques like word2Vec, GloVe(global vectors for word representation),Bert(Bi-directional encoder
    representation from transformers) and FastText
-GloVe and FastText are pretrained models


#Text Classification
-Used to assign a class to a given text for separation or better analyzation


#Text Summarization
-Creating a short, accurate,fluent summary of long text documents
-Types:
    -Extractive Methods: the steps are; Tokenization--> get word_frequency--> get normalized_word_frequency-->sentence tokenization -->
                         -->calculate score for each sentence--> rank the sentences
    -Abstractive Methods:


#Movie Recommendation
-Focus is on purpose,methods,use-cases and applications
-Methods of movie recommendation system:
    >Demographic filtering -generalized filter eg age group, gender, location etc
    >Content based filtering -based on features of the movies eg directors, genre etc
    >Collaborative filtering - other users with similar interests
